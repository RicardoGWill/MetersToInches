# MetersToInches
This app converts meters to inches.  It makes sure that the EditText has text in it, and makes the EditText input first into a Double for math and then turns the result into a BigDecimal.  Another thing to note is that if there is just a "1", then the singular "meter"/"inch" is used instead of the plural.
